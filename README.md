# OpenFin <> AdapTable Integration Example

This demo shows how you can use OpenFin inside AdapTable.

The code is using TypeScript for convenience - but it could easily be just JavaScript.

## Installation

NOTE: In order to be able to run `npm install`, you need to follow the [AdapTable installation instructions](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/dev-guide-installation) - so you need to be logged into our private NPM registry.

Run `npm install` (or `yarn`), depending on what tool you're using.

## Running for development

```sh
$ npm run start
```

This command will start `create-react-app` and open the browser at `localhost:3000`. NOTE however that it will not work in the browser, because you have to run it in openfin with the next command:

```sh
$ npm run start-openfin
```

This will start the actual OpenFin app, where you can see the AdapTable integration running.

## Using the OpenFin Plugin

You will see that this example includes the OpenFin plugin. This gives the user access to the OpenFin only functionality in AdapTable.

This includes 'Live Excel' - note how 'ItemCount' in the first row is continually incrementing.

If you export 'All Data' to Excel from the OpenFin toolbar it will automatically open Excel (assuming you have a version on your machine) and the spreadsheet will update every 2 seconds as the Grid ticks.
